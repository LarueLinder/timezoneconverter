For this code, we chose not to include the GMT notation as we thought it may be confusing for the
user, and we thought we should keep the app simple by only showing the time. In our opinion, it
makes sense to have multiple activities because the Settings and Main Activities perform different
functions and Settings has the Home City editor that is not used in the Main Activity. Also, in
general, one Activity implements one screen/view in an App, and we wanted to save and restore
instance data as activities move in and out of visibility, so two Activities made the most sense.
In order to test the code, we ran the clock with multiple combinations of location and AM/PM and
checked the results against the “World Clock” feature on the iOS Clock application. Our base test
was NYC/LA with the current time. The most challenging part of the app was the SharedPreferences,
especially when we first made them. Understanding when and when not to save data into
SharedPreferences was difficult, but we now have a better grasp on the concept.
